	If Particle_Position is equal to a function named
	Particle_Position_function, the C++ code will call the lua
	function and allow the script to generate a unique set of
	positions.
	
	The return value expected is a 2D array, where the number of
	rows is equal to AmountOfPositionsToGenerate and the number of
	columns is exactly 3.

			GeV/c
		
		"Four Vector, with name"
		
			Name, <E/c, P_x, P_y, P_z> 
			where Name is the name of the particle being described
		
		"Four Vector, with name, with position"
			
			Name, <E/c, P_x, P_y, P_z>, <X, Y, Z>
			where <X, Y, Z> define the position of the particle with
			respect to the origin of the world box, with units of
			metres.
